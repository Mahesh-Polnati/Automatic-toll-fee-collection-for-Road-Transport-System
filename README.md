# Automatic-toll-fee-collection-for-Road-Transport-System
Automatic toll fee collection system based on number plate detection
This system is based on detecting the number plate from the front view of car
The number plate is detected using OpenCv and the detected plate image is sent to tesseract
The tesseract extracts the Registration number of vehicle
The Registration number so extracted was mapped with vehicle data to find the toll fare
Then the bill was printed.
This system was designed mainly for Indian number plates
